# chess-timer-unity

This is a simple UI game to implement time control for a game of chess. Allows you to select from a given list how long each player has for the game, and allows for bonus time. 

Hitting the active (orange) clock stops the clock and activates the opponents for their turn. Can pause and reset the timer, or exit and change the timer settings.
